<h1>HTML, advanced</h1>

This task is the first step in creating a website that uses HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. This task consists of creating an HTML document from a .fig file, a visual representation of a web page (wireframe) created by a designer.  <br>
<br>Only HTML (HyperText Markup Language) will be used in this task, focusing on the arrangement of the content according to its functionality.   <br><br>
To complete the task, we will be using a designer-developer collaboration tool called Figma available in the cloud at [figma.com](http://figma.com "figma.com").<br><br>
