HTML, advanced

This task is the first step in creating a website that uses HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. This task consists of creating an HTML document from a .fig file, a visual representation of a web page (wireframe) created by a designer.  <br>
<br>Only HTML (HyperText Markup Language) will be used in this task, focusing on the arrangement of the content according to its functionality. In the following image we can see how the HTML document is displayed in search engines.  <br>
