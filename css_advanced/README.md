<h1>HTML, advanced</h1>

This is the second step in creating a website, that uses HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. This project consists of creating and deploying a website from a HTML document and a .fig file, a visual representation of a web page (wireframe) created by a designer.  <br>
<br>Only CSS will be added, focusing on the style of the elements of the website.   <br><br>
To complete the task, we will be using a designer-developer collaboration tool called Figma available in the cloud at [figma.com](http://figma.com "figma.com").<br><br>
